      "Not only is Brittany an amazing facilitator she is also a great designer. I am very impressed with her drive to continually push herself to learn and grow. She is stretched herself beyond her role as a facilitator at the University of Phoenix and jumped in and created flyers, handouts, PowerPoint and participant guides for our staff! Brittany has a positive attitude and is just a joy to be around. I’m very impressed with her creativity and eye for design. In addition to that she’s volunteering her own time as a designer to DESIGNxHUMANITY. I look forward to seeing what she does in the future! ",
